# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Reward Report System - Ajay Mohandas
Contains the backend logic for rewards calculations

## Goal

Users can view their reward balances, spend points and system to record every transaction as per payer, points and timestamp
### Rules
- We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received)
- We want no payer's points to go negative

### Expectation
- Add transactions for a specific payer and date.
- Spend points using the rules above and return a list for each call
- Return all payer point balances

Problem Statement - https://fetch-hiring.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/points.pdf

## Assumptions
> No database to persist the data and hence each time you run the application user data would be null

> Basic validation are performed by the application, added spring security can be added but is not present in this application

> Since its a simple application, apis do not have any header or token for authorization

## How to run the project

### Pre-requisite
- Install any version above Java 8 but tried and tested in [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) and [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html), 
- Install any IDE of your choice [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to test APIs

### Run from IDE
- Make sure IDE supports Spring Application, if not add plugins for Spring Application
- If using VS Code, go to marketplace and install plugins for Spring
- Clone the project using [GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) to a local folder using `https://github.com/ajaymohandas89/FetchRewardsPointsSystems`
- Simply run the PointsApplication.java
- Application will be running on http://localhost:8080
- Test the backend services using API testing tool
- Import API collection in Postman using Import and upload FetchRewards_UserPointsProblem.postman_collection.json or test using below API curl commands
